        <p>The Arena is poisoned; your HP and MP will gradually drop as you run.</p>
        <p>You need to reach a tree sitting a little ways ahead.</p>
        <p>On the way there, you will see Dan nearby. Choose to stay hidden. (the other option is a ticket to a Dead End)</p>
        <p>Now continue to the tree and destroy it.</p>
        <p>You are now free to continue through the dungeon.</p>
        <p>Be sure to pick up the 1st Trigger on your way through.</p>

        <p>The first is at the location where you destroyed the Yew Tree.</p>
        <p>The 2nd is in the southwest corner of the large middle area. Note the Box of Persimmon is also in this room, so be sure to pick it up as well.</p>
        <p>The 3rd is at a dead end from the 2nd left after heading north from the middle area.</p>

        <p>If you want to stop by the Chapel or Commissary, warp there via the square button and definitely do <strong>not</strong> go on foot via 1F. With that out of the way...</p>
        <p>Go to 1F for an event. Choose to escape to the Arena (running to the schoolyard leads to a Dead End).</p>
        <p>Move through the Arena normally toward the large central area for an event. You get Matrix Level 1.</p>
        <p>Hurry to the north exit and leave.</p>

        <p>You'll need to hit a switch at the far east to open the door to reach the 2nd Trigger. Pick it up due south from the path to the north exit once the door is open.</p>
        <p>
            Be sure to pick up the Demonic Eye Blocker (would otherwise be translated as Mystic Eye Killer, for the Type-Moon faithful who might be wondering how "glasses" refers to that [the rest of the game makes it pretty obvious the translator for the NA release of this game had never touched anything Type-Moon related before]) from the northwest while you're here.

        <p>Enter Arena 2F.</p>
        <p>Go to the room right before the north exit to meet Dan and fight his Servant. Note he always uses Poison Arrow on the 2nd turn of round 2 and Wall of Thorns on the 6th turn of round 3. You get Matrix Level 3.</p>

        <p>You can check the Library for more information about yesterday's encounter if you want.</p>
        <p>Give Demonic Eye Blocker to Taiga on 1F.</p>

        <span class="card-title">Day 7</span>

        <p>Go to your Private Room and organize your information to get Matrix Level E.</p>
        <p>I would highly recommend for you to equip the Exorcist Blade and/or buy several Remedy.</p>
        <p>When you're finished preparing, talk to Kotomine on 1F.</p>

                Archer always uses Guard for his first turn every single round. That means you can either use Break or freely use buff Skills for your first turn. He uses Poison Shot on the 2nd turn of every other round (that means he uses it, then skips a round, then uses it, then skips, and so on). This has a high chance to poison you. I would recommend you use Hack to stop him from using it entirely. If you ever are poisoned at the end of a round, he will use his Noble Phantasm the 2nd turn of the next round without fail. Use a Remedy to cure your poison quickly, and you don't have to worry about his Noble Phantasm: it has no effect on you whatsoever if you're not poisoned at the time when he uses it. He sometimes uses Wall of Thorns to attack you on either the 3rd or 6th turn. It doesn't do much damage, so you can just Guard it if you don't want to use Hack (note you can't heal and use Hack in the same round, something you should always keep in mind when basing your tactics on it). He also has a buff called Faceless King which he very rarely uses at low health that essentially makes him immune to all basic attacks for 1 round. Use Skills instead if he actually uses it.
