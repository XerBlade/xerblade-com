        <p>The Commissary is open now downstairs from 1F. You should stop by and buy some healing items.</p>
        <p>Go to the Roof and talk to Rin.</p>
        <p>Talk to the girl in your class with a marker above her head.</p>
        <p>Go to the 3F east hall and talk to Rani.</p>
        <p>Go to the Roof and talk to Rin.</p>
        <p>Go to 1F and talk to Kotomine.</p>
        <p>You can now access your Private Room where the 2-B classroom used to be in the 2F west hallway. You can go there anytime to speak with your Servant in private.</p>
        <p>Talk to Taiga in the 1F lobby and accept her request to find her Kendo Sword.</p>
        <p>Go to the Arena entrance at the end of the 1F west hall. Enter Arena 1F.</p>

            </div>
        </div>

        <p>Grind in here for a while to gain a couple levels. Your Servant won't let you approach the bee-type enemy blocking your path forward. Leave the Arena to end your day.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <div class="card-content">
        <span class="card-title">Day 2</span>

        <p>Check the bulletin board.</p>
        <p>Talk to Kotomine in front of the 2F stairs. You must collect 2 Cipher Keys—one from each floor of the Arena—by the end of each week to progress.</p>
        <p>Go to 1F and talk to Shinji.</p>
        <p>Talk to Sakura in the Nurse's Office to obtain your weekly item.</p>
        <p>Enter the Arena 1F.</p>
        <p>Head north. You will run into Shinji at the point you couldn't pass through yesterday.</p>
        <p>You will fight his Servant. Your goal is just to survive for 3 turns—pretty easy in this case. For future reference, this is always the goal for mid-week Servant battles in the Arena. She uses her attack Skill only on the 3rd action. You get Matrix Level 1 from this encounter.</p>
        <p>Continue on through the dungeon. Be sure to collect the 1st Trigger and the Kendo Sword.</p>
        <p>Leave when you're done to end your day.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <div class="card-content">
        <span class="card-title">Day 3</span>

        <p>Head to the 2F east hall in front of the Library to see an event. You get Matrix Level 2 (note: Shinji is the king of idiots).</p>
        <p>Check the marked shelf at the Library if you want to learn more. Speak to the girl in the back with the marker above her head.</p>
        <p>Grind in the Arena until you're satisfied, then end your day.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <div class="card-content">
        <span class="card-title">Day 4</span>

        <p>Shinji's up to something (probably something ridiculously idiotic as usual). You need to investigate.</p>
        <p>Talk to Rin in front of the 2F stairs.</p>
        <p>Head to the Library and check the marked bookshelf.</p>
        <p>Talk to Shinji so that he can explain his master plan to you (well, that was easy).</p>
        <p>Go to 1F and talk to Kotomine.</p>
        <p>The Chapel is now open. You can go there from now on to assign any stat points you've earned through leveling up. You should go there right now to spend what you have built up until now. I will not be reminding you to return to the Chapel from here on. Recognize when it's needed and do it.</p>
        <p>Leave the Chapel for an event with Shinji.</p>
        <p>Talk to Taiga in the 1F lobby to give her the Kendo Sword. Accept her quest to get her fruit.</p>
        <p>Go to your Private Room for an important conversation with your Servant. For Saber or Archer, pick the 3rd option. For Caster, select the 1st option.</p>
        <p>Enter the Arena 2F.</p>

        <div class="card z-depth-0">

                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>There is a switch to the west of the sealed door that opens it. They will not usually be this close by in the future.</p>
        <p>After the long hallway running from west to east along the north side of the map, take the southernmost path at the fork. Your Servant will point out that there is a hidden passage and that Shinji is just the type to hide his stuff in a conspicuous place like that—although you've passed 2 more of those already, so one has to wonder why your Servant didn't say anything then.</p>
        <p>Shinji will rush toward your location. You have to survive 3 rounds again—even less of a challenge this time. You get Matrix Level 3.</p>
        <p>Continue through the dungeon. Be sure to grab the Tangerine along the path and the 2nd Trigger right before you reach the exit. Definitely grab the Exorcist Blade close by as well, as it's easily one of the most useful Formal Wears in the game.</p>
        <p>Leave the Arena when you're done.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <div class="card-content">
        <span class="card-title">Day 5</span>

        <p>Go to the Arena entrance for an event.</p>
        <p>Check the door to the Nurse's Office.</p>
        <p>You can now use the square button to fast travel within the school.</p>
        <p>Go to the 2F east hall in front of the Library for an event with Rin and Shinji. You can check the marked bookshelf inside the Library for more info on yesterday's encounter if you want.</p>
        <p>Check Shinji's desk in the 2-A classroom.</p>
        <p>Go to Arena 2F and grind until you're satisfied.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <div class="card-content">
        <span class="card-title">Day 6</span>

        <p>Talk to Taiga and give her the Tangerine.</p>
        <p>Go to the Arena entrance to see an event.</p>
        <p>Enter Arena 2F.</p>
        <p>The goal for this event is to grab more Pirate Booty than Shinji. Each one he gets will strengthen his Servant a bit.</p>
        <p>Under normal circumstances, it is impossible to get the first 2. If you can catch Shinji and force him into a fight, he will leave the Arena, allowing you to get the rest for yourself. This should be your immediate goal. Chase after him—rest assured that time freezes for him if you get into a battle with a regular enemy. After he picks up his 2nd Pirate Booty conveniently placed at a dead end, you can easily cut him off in front of the place where you picked up the book the other day. Do so.</p>
        <p>[Note: If you're playing a New Game +, you can just use Enhancement Spike to increase your speed and catch up to him before he even reaches the first one. This way, you can collect all 5.]</p>
        <p>Once Shinji has left, collect the remaining treasure at your leisure. This is your last chance to grind before facing this week's boss, so make sure you reach a level you are satisfied with. Leave the Arena when you're finished.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <div class="card-content">
        <span class="card-title">Day 7</span>

        <p>Go to your Private Room and organize your information. You can retry as much as you need if you make a wrong choice, and the questions are easy anyway, so have at it. After you've answered everything correctly, you get Matrix Level E.</p>
        <p>You should assign any unused points at the Chapel and buy recovery items at the Commissary. You can also sell the Pirate Booty for 2000 PPT each.</p>
        <p>I would strongly recommend equipping the Exorcist Blade.</p>
        <p>When you're finished preparing, talk to Kotomine in front of the elevator on 1F.</p>
        <div class="card-panel z-depth-0">
            <span class="card-title">
                Boss Strategy: <span class="reveal-labelled reveal-delay" data-position="right" data-tooltip="Francis Drake">Rider <span class="reveal-label reveal-label-right">Francis Drake</span></span>
            </span>
            <p>This is an easy fight. While Rider has more than 30% HP remaining, she will use a support Skill to buff herself for the first action of every turn that it is not already applied. If you use Hack from the Exorcist Blade to prevent her from using it, she will keep attempting to use it every turn. This limits her to only 2 possible patterns, alternating either Breaks or Guards with Attacks.</p>
            <p>If you ever give her a chance to use it, Rider will only use her attack Skill for her 3rd action.</p>
            <p>Once Rider falls below 30% HP, she will start to use her Noble Phantasm. She always uses it for her 6th action. You can also use Hack to prevent her from using it entirely.</p>
