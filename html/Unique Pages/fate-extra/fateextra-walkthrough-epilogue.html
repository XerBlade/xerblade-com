        <p>There is no longer any penalty of time passage for entering or leaving the Arena, so you can leave and return as much as you want and train as much as you like.</p>
        <p>The Arena is now just a straight hall with one large room. It contains three enemy types, Claustrophobia and Nephilim:Δ from the last week, and one new enemy, Babel's Piece. They give good EXP for training.</p>
        <p>
            If you're on a New Game + (and you have been following this guide from the beginning; this also requires that you completed every side quest), you can face an optional boss by heading to the north exit and choosing to keep going.

                Optional Boss Strategy:
                <span class="reveal-labelled reveal-delay" data-position="right" data-tooltip="Ryougi Shiki">
                    Monster
                    <div class="reveal-label reveal-label-right">Ryougi Shiki</div>
                </span>
            </span>
            <p>Equip the Exorcist Blade and bring a lot of Elixers. You should rely on the Elixers for all HP and MP recovery, so use the other Formal Wear slot on something more directly useful than recovery.</p>
            <p>Monster always uses Twin Towers for her first action of the first turn. This attack deals a lot of damage, so prevent or defend against it. She will use this Skill again for the first action every 10 turns. Once she has low health, she will start using it for her 6th action.</p>
            <p>She has four other unblockable attack Skills that ignore Guard and have a chance to seal one of your actions between Attack, Guard, Break, or Skill. If you use the matching action when she uses one of those Skills, it will be sealed. Otherwise, you still take magic damage. This can make spamming attack Skills to cover slots you can't see risky since all 3 Servants you could be using will be in trouble without Skills. However, she will never use more than one Skill per turn, and she only uses sealing Skills every 3 turns. The sealing effects are permanent, unlike typical status ailments, and cannot be cured. The only ways you can avoid it are with Archer's 7 Rings of Heaven, Hack, or Caster's Skills that can stun on the following action. And that last one is not a guarantee.</p>
            <p>If your Attack, Guard, and Break are all sealed, Monster will use her Noble Phantasm. This is an utterly unavoidable guaranteed instant kill. Not even Saber's Thrice-Setting Sun can save you.</p>
            <p>The best way to fight her is to go all-in on Skill spam and use up all of those Elixers you've been saving to keep it going. She has a ton of HP, so if you hold back and try to conserve those Elixers, you will be in for a very long battle, which is the last thing you want. Take her down hard and fast before she has many chances to get lucky with those sealing Skills. The best defense is definitely a good offense when it comes to this fight. Her attack patterns are relatively easy to read, and her basic attacks aren't all that strong. The most important thing is to keep your worries in check. Use Hack to stop any Skill you can see to be on the safe side, keep your MP up, and be aggressive, and you will be fine.</p>

            When you think you've trained enough, prepare for the end. To prepare for New Game +, go to the Commissary and buy any Formal Wears you think you might have a use for in your next trip, noting you keep those but your level is reset to 1. Your consumable items do not carry over but your money does, so sell any and all of those you aren't planning on using for the final battle.
        </p>
        <p>When you've finished preparing, talk to <span class="red-text">Rin</span>/<span class="blue-text">Rani</span> on 1F.</p>
        <p>You just have to run straight and let things play out, until...</p>

                Final Boss Strategy:
                <span class="reveal-labelled reveal-delay">
                    Savior
                    <div class="reveal-label reveal-label-right">Buddha</div>
                </span>
            </span>
            <p>
                Savior will use his Noble Phantasm which is an automatic Game Over after 14 turns, but you should have this finished long before that, so you should have no reason to worry about it. Twice will sometimes use a Code that seals your Skills. The only way to heal this seal is with Sakura's weekly lunches or with the Scarlet Formal Wear's Code. Anyway, just be aggressive and give him everything you've got. Don't be afraid to spam your strongest Skills constantly and use Elixirs to recover your MP. I mean, if you don't use them now, then what are you saving them for? This battle isn't that difficult, all things considered.

        <p>Congratulations, enjoy the ending!</p>

            After the credits and everything are done, you are prompted to save a Clear Data file. You can load from this file to start a new game that skips the Prologue and carries over your Formal Wears (minus story-oriented ones) and money from the previous game. Your level still starts at 1 though, and you have the option to pick a different Servant from the first time. This is best used as your opportunity to try out the story with the other two Servants and/or with choosing the <span class="red-text">Rani</span>/<span class="blue-text">Rin</span> Route instead of <span class="red-text">Rin</span>/<span class="blue-text">Rani</span> at your leisure.
