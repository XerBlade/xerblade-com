        <p>Check the Bulletin Board.</p>
        <p>Talk to the boy in front of the Library.</p>
        <p>Talk to <span class="red-text">Rani</span>/<span class="blue-text">Rin</span> in front of the 2F stairs.</p>

        <p>Check the fountain.</p>
        <p>Talk to the marked girl on 3F.</p>
        <p>The Sword of Repentance is now available in the Commissary. I would highly recommend that you buy it. It's practically an upgraded version of Exorcist Blade that stuns against all enemy actions instead of just Skills.</p>
        <p>[Note: At this point, enemies can be very hard to predict. Especially the first time you fight them. I would recommend you start equipping Shockwave-2nd Strike and Sword of Repentance to get around this. With Shockwave, you can press X to make your Servant take a preemptive strike against an enemy in the Arena before you enter battle with them. This causes them to be stunned for their first 2 actions. The Code that Sword of Repentance gives you, Shock, is another stun for any 3rd action of your choice. That gives you at least 3 moves in the first turn where you have a guaranteed advantage.]</p>
        <p>Go to the Arena entrance for an event.</p>
        <p>Enter Arena 1F.</p>

        <p>You can pass the barrier today and explore the rest of the dungeon. Be sure to pick up the 1st Trigger in the large room in the northwest.</p>
        <p>[Note: You can find a Formal Wear called Shockwave-3rd Strike in the room at the end of the last branch before the exit. This is actually tactically weaker than 2nd Strike, so don't switch to it if you have been using that.]</p>
        <p>There is a Nephilim just beyond the final hallway to the exit.</p>

        <p>If you have Archer or Caster, go to your Private Room for an important conversation. For Caster, choose option 1. If you've defeated all available Nephilim so far, that makes 5, so exit and reenter afterward for another conversation with a Skill upgrade. If you haven't, no worries, there are plenty more. Archer has no decisions to make.</p>

        <p>You reach a barrier halfway through the map. Activate the switch when you're ready for a battle. You will have to fight the Servant's Effigy. This works the same as a standard Arena Servant battle. You get Matrix Level 2.</p>
        <p>You can't continue beyond this point today, so backtrack for now.</p>

        <p>Proceed through the dungeon until you meet the Effigy. This time, you need to kill it instead of surviving for 3 turns. It's pretty weak now.</p>
        <p>After the battle, go to where you found the barrier yesterday and keep moving straight forward to the end of the hall. Fight Moby Dick. This enemy isn't that hard, but it has a lot of HP.</p>
        <p>Explore the rest of the dungeon. Make sure you grab the Kofta Kebab from the room in the middle of the big looped hallway, the Spring Roll from the room to the southeast, and the 2nd Trigger right before the exit.</p>
        <p>A Formal Wear named Seer's Crystal Ball is next to the Kofta Kebab. Using its Code allows you to see the entire Arena map. Areas you have not explored yet are dimmed. You can unequip it after using it, and its effect will remain. However, similar to the Enhancement Spike, it's temporary. You will need to reactivate it after it wears off.</p>

                Boss Strategy:
                <span class="reveal-labelled reveal-delay">
                    Berserker
                    <div class="reveal-label reveal-label-right">Lu Bu</div>
                </span>
            </span>
            <p>Both Berserker and his Master love to buff a lot, so you might want to consider equipping Maleficent Garments to use the Vanish Add Code to remove them.</p>
            <p>His Armistice buff, which he sometimes uses for his 1st action, adds stun to his Break. Either prevent this or remove it as soon as you can, or the momentum will shift in his favor really quickly.</p>
            <p>He sometimes uses Fallible Bow for his 2nd, 3rd, or 4th actions. This deals damage and stuns you for 2 moves. Needless to say, getting hit by this is not good. Try to hit him with Hack or Shock instead.</p>
            <p>Immortal Red Hair, which he uses any time he falls below 20% HP, will revive him with 10% HP if he's killed, so be ready to either remove it or prevent him from using that one entirely.</p>
            <p>Before he uses his Noble Phantasm, his Master will say "God Force" again during her line. She says it once in a different line before the first turn, which doesn't count. For that turn, he will use Wait for all actions aside from the Noble Phantasm. His Noble Phantasm will most likely kill you if not defended against, so keep that in mind.</p>
            <p>Bring plenty of recovery items and keep your HP high because he deals crazy high damage. Luckily, he spends a lot of his actions on Wait.</p>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <span class="card-title blue-text">
                Boss Strategy:
                <span class="reveal-labelled reveal-delay">
                    Lancer
                    <div class="reveal-label reveal-label-right">Cu Chulainn</div>
                </span>
            </span>
            <p>Any time you see an enemy Code Cast attached to an action, Lancer will use an attack Skill at the same time. This always happens for his first or third move. If you're lucky, this Skill will be Medium Lance, which only deals damage. His Master always pairs this with Call Fortune, which reduces your luck for 3 turns. This typically isn't so bad, but it synergizes well with his Noble Phantasm, which is greatly affected by your luck stat.</p>
            <p>His Hammering Assault, however, also causes Paralysis. Unfortunately, his Master pairs it with the Call Gandor Code, which often causes stun itself, so trying to defend against the Skill is unreliable. You should probably use Shock to stop it instead.</p>
            <p>When his HP is low, he will start using Hammering Assault for his 1st action and Median Lance for his 3rd action in the same turn. But, of course, his Master only pairs a Code Cast with one of them. Also, he buffs himself with Shoal of Extremities, which significantly increases his attack and defense and revives him with 8% HP when he dies. If you remove it, he will apply it again in the next turn. So try not to let him use it in the first place.</p>
            <p>Lancer will say, "Nja mā, buchikamasu ka nē!" before using his Noble Phantasm, always for the 4th or 6th action. It does random damage and can't be defended against with Guard—it can be an instant kill if you're unlucky. So try to kill him before he uses it, or hope you get lucky. Or find another way besides Guard to defend against it, you know.</p>
            <p>Lancer will always use the same basic actions for the 2nd and 3rd moves or the 4th and 5th moves, but not both. For example, if you can see that the 2nd and 3rd actions are not the same, you know the 4th and 5th will be the same. If they are the same, the 4th and 5th will be different. If he uses a Skill for his 3rd move, the 4th and 5th must be the same. Similarly, if he uses his Noble Phantasm for his 4th action, the 2nd and 3rd must be the same. This way, you can easily predict many of his patterns.</p>
