        <span class="card-title">Day 1</span>

        <p>Check the Bulletin Board.</p>
        <p>Talk to the boy in front of the Library.</p>
        <p>Head to the stairs and talk with <span class="red-text">Rani</span>/<span class="blue-text">Rin</span>.</p>
        <p>Talk to Kotomine on 1F.</p>
        <p>Talk to Taiga to receive a quest to get a magazine.</p>
        <p>Talk to Sakura in the Nurse's Office.</p>
        <p>Talk to the girl next to the fountain in front of the Chapel.</p>
        <p>Check the fountain.</p>
        <p>Go to 3F and talk to the marked girl.</p>
        <p>Sword of Repentance is now available in the Commissary. I would highly recommend you buy it. It's more or less an upgraded version of Exorcist Blade that seals all enemy actions instead of just Skills.</p>
        <p>
            [Note: From here on, enemies can be very hard to predict, especially the first time you fight them. I would recommend you start equipping Shockwave-2nd Strike and Sword of Repentance to get around this. With Shockwave, you can press X to make your Servant take a preemptive strike against an enemy in the Arena before you enter battle with them, which causes them to be stunned for their first 2 turns. The Code that Sword of Repentance gives you, Shock, is effectively another stun on a 3rd turn of your choice. That gives you at least 3 turns in the first round against an enemy where you can fight them easily.]

        <p>Enter Arena 1F.</p>

        <p>You can pass the barrier. Explore the rest of the dungeon and be sure to pick up the 1st Trigger in the northwest.</p>
        <p>[Note: You can find an item called Shockwave-3rd Strike near the exit. This is actually tactically weaker than 2nd Strike, so don't switch to it if you have been using 2nd Strike.]</p>

        <p>
            If you have Archer or Caster, go to your Private Room for an important conversation. For Caster, choose 1, and, if you've defeated all of the available Nephilim so far, that makes 5, so exit and reenter afterwards for another conversation with a Skill upgrade (if you haven't, no worries, there are plenty more). Archer has no choices.

        <p>Move through the dungeon normally until you reach a barrier halfway through the map.</p>
        <p>
            Activate the switch to open the barrier when ready. You will have to fight the Servant's Effigy. This works the same as a normal Servant battle. You get Matrix Level 2. You can't continue past this point today, so backtrack for now.

        <p>Enter Arena 2F.</p>
        <p>Return in the direction of where you faced the Effigy yesterday, and fight it again. This time, kill it rather than the normal surviving for 3 turns. It's pretty weak now.</p>
        <p>After the battle, go to where you couldn't get past yesterday and keep moving perfectly straight forward past it to enter a hidden passage. Fight Moby Dick. This enemy isn't hard, but it has a lot of HP.</p>
        <p>Explore the rest of the dungeon normally. Make sure you grab the 2nd Trigger right before the exit, Kofta Kebab from the room in the middle of the large rectangular hall, and Spring Roll from the southeast.</p>

                <span class="reveal-labelled reveal-delay">

                Berserker and his Master love to buff like crazy, so you might want to consider equipping Maleficent Garments to use the Vanish Add Code to remove them. One buff in particular, which he uses any time he falls below 20% HP, will revive him if he's killed, so definitely be ready to either remove or prevent him from using that one entirely. Bring plenty of recovery items and try to keep your HP high, because he has crazy high attack. Before the round when he uses his Noble Phantasm, his Master will say "God Force" again during her line (she says it once in a different line before the first round, which doesn't count). On that round, he will use Wait on all turns aside from the Noble Phantasm. His Noble Phantasm will pretty much instant kill you if not defended against, so keep that in mind. Luckily, he spends a lot of his turns on Wait.

            <p>
                Any time you see an enemy Code Cast attached to a turn, Lancer will use an attack Skill on that same turn. You should probably use Shock to stop this, as all but the first time his attack also causes Paralysis. His Noble Phantasm does random damage and is normally unguardable (can be an instant kill if you're unlucky). Try to kill him before he uses it, or hope you get lucky. Or find another way besides Guard to defend against it, you know. If he falls below 20% HP, he will use Shoal of Extremities, which greatly buffs his attack and defense for the rest of the fight and automatically revives him once when killed. Try not to let him do this, have debuffs ready, or just finish him from 20% to 0 in a single round with all your might.
