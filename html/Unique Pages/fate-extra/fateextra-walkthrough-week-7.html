        <span class="card-title">Day 1</span>

        <p>Check the bulletin board. You start with Matrix Level 1 this time.</p>
        <p>Leave the classroom and go out into the hall for an event with Kotomine.</p>
        <p>Talk to Sakura in the Nurse's Office to get your weekly item.</p>
        <p>Go to the Arena entrance for an event.</p>
        <p>Enter Arena 1F.</p>

        <p>The side paths are sealed for now, so just follow the path directly to the end.</p>
        <p>
            Right before the exit, you have a boss fight against a Berserker. Berserker always uses a strong attack Skill for his first move, so use Shock/Hack, Guard, or a defensive Skill to counter it. Other than that, he's pretty weak at this point in the game, so you should finish him quickly.
        </p>
        <p>Leave when you're done.</p>

        <span class="card-title">Day 2</span>

        <p>Talk to <span class="red-text">Rin(Roof)</span>/<span class="blue-text">Rani(3F)</span>.</p>
        <p>Go to the Arena entrance for an event with your Servant. Pick the 1st choice.</p>
        <p>Enter Arena 1F.</p>
        <p>Continue through the Arena until an event with your Servant happens. For Saber, choose 2, then 1. For Archer, pick the 1st choice. For Caster, choose 1, then 1.</p>
        <p>You face a boss fight against SE.RE.PH, which is incredibly easy. I would recommend spamming attack Skills for a quick victory.</p>
        <p>Continue through the dungeon normally. Make sure you get the 1st Trigger just to the west of the north exit.</p>
        <p>Leave when you're done.</p>

        <span class="card-title">Day 3</span>

        <p>Go to your Private Room for an important conversation. For Archer, pick the 2nd choice. The others have no choices. You should now have Matrix Level E for your own Servant.</p>
        <p>Talk to <span class="red-text">Rin(Roof)</span>/<span class="blue-text">Rani(3F)</span>.</p>
        <p>Talk to Taiga on 1F to accept a new quest.</p>
        <p>Go to the Arena entrance for an event with Leo.</p>
        <p>Enter Arena 2F.</p>

            Go through the dungeon normally. Make sure to definitely grab the Teacher's Emblem from the eastern section while you're here, since it can only be obtained this day. Also you should probably grab the Staff of Rebuke from the northwest, considering it's the strongest of all of the 2 Formal Wear with MP Heal in the game.
        </p>
        <p>Advance through the south hall from the large central room to get an event.</p>
        <p>Backtrack a bit to meet Leo and have a fight. Note Shock doesn't really work, so don't bother trying it. You get Matrix Level 2.</p>
        <p>You can't advance beyond this point, so backtrack and explore any of the 1st half of the dungeon that you haven't covered yet.</p>
        <p>Leave when you're done.</p>

        <p>Go to 3F and check the door to the Multimedia Room.</p>
        <p>Talk to Taiga on 1F for a quest update.</p>
        <p>Enter Arena 1F. Yes, you read that right, <em>1F</em>.</p>
        <p>Head to the location right in front of the north exit where you fought Berserker on the 1st day to pick up a feather.</p>
        <p>Leave when you're done.</p>

        <p>Go to the Arena entrance for an event with Leo.</p>
        <p>Enter Arena 2F.</p>
        <p>Explore the remaining half of the dungeon today.</p>
        <p>Go to the Trigger location (at the end of a long hall directly north of the exit) to meet Leo. Tell him he's wrong, and fight him. You get Matrix Level 3.</p>
        <p>With the fight over, pick up the 2nd Trigger.</p>
        <p>Make sure you have grabbed the Tiger Thermos from the northwest corner of the southwest section before you leave.</p>
        <p>Leave when you're done.</p>

        <p>Enter Arena 2F and train until you're satisfied.</p>

        <span class="card-title">Day 7</span>

        <p>Go to your Private Room and organize your information to get Matrix Level E.</p>
        <p>Shock is not effective, so equip something else in place of the standard Sword of Repentance.</p>
        <p>When you're finished preparing, talk to Kotomine on 1F.</p>

                Saber will always buff himself with Divine Aegis and Siege Perilous on the first round. Divine Aegis is only ever used on the 2nd turn, and Siege Perilous on the 5th. Siege Perilous makes his successful Guard counters stun you for the next turn, so watch out for that. He will sometimes use the attack Skill Blade of the Devoted on his 3rd turn, so Guard if you're uncertain. Watch out for if it's showing it coupled with a Code Cast, because Leo will sometimes lead it with his Bomb Code to stun your Guard ability making you unable to Guard against it. If that happens and you have Saber, there's nothing to do but say "what the hell" and use an attack Skill of your own at the same time, and have a heal ready, otherwise, if you don't have Saber, use a defensive Skill. He will start using his Noble Phantasm when he falls below half health. Saber always says "Leo..." in a pained voice before a round when he's going to use it, and he always uses it on the 6th turn. Guard or use a defensive Skill if available to defend against it. When he falls below 10% HP, he will use the buff Numeral of the Saint on the 4th turn, which greatly increases his defense for one round. It's best if you kill him before he can do that, in other words, once you get him to 10%, quickly finish him in one go.
